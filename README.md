# simple_architecture_flutter

This is not an app. I will build an architecture in this repository to build robust and easy-to-maintain products but in a faster way.

## Info
I'm going to use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to make this project.

## Why did I create this repository?

Having strong, robust architectures that follow all the principles is actually pretty good but recently I feel like it's a bit overkill for most projects. Even though I love to make complicated and strong applications, I need to build products fast, and obviously having complicated architectures that have many folders and abstract classes is not the way to do it. So, nowadays I'm more prone to follow the "YAGNI" and "KISS" principles and focus on building products fast while paying attention to writing clean code.


## What am I going to do?

I'm going to simplify my old architecture which is actually quite enough for big projects but doesn't have the ability to build products quickly. I will determine the "unnecessary" structures or the structures that are used rarely and delete them or replace them with the simpler ones. Of course, it will not be finished in one day but I guess it will be ready to use in a week after the repository was created. I will maintain it as long as I'm a Flutter Developer.

## The purpose of this architecture

I don't say that this is going to be the best architecture for building projects. But I can say that if you want to build products in a fast way while paying attention to maintainability and clean code, then this repository can be the one for you.

## Things that I'll handle

- Feature Architecture (Data, Domain, Presentation layers) - [Current]
- ViewModels and state management - [Current]
- Navigation - [Later]
- Theming - [Later]
- Dependency Injection - [Later]
- Localization - [Later]

## Contribution

I know that there are a lot better developers who can contribute to this project out there. Please feel free to contribute this application since It's the only way to make a repository a lot better. Thanks!


Thanks for reading! Have a greay day :)
